# Assumptions

1. Scalability:
   The application is designed with the potential to handle dozens of thousands of candidates in the future, but the current implementation focuses on functionality rather than large-scale optimization.

2. Email as Unique Identifier:
   Email is used as the unique identifier for candidates, assuming each candidate has a unique email address. This choice was made based on the requirement to update existing records if the email already exists.

3. Optional Fields:
   The phone number, call time interval, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL fields are considered optional, as they are not marked with an asterisk in the requirements.

4. Data Persistence:
   The use of SQLite for local development and Turso for production assumes that these databases will be sufficient for the current scale of the application.

5. Server-Side Rendering:
   The application uses server-side rendering and server actions for form submission, assuming this approach provides better performance and SEO benefits for this type of application.

6. Dark Mode:
   Dark mode is implemented assuming users might prefer different color schemes for better visibility, especially during extended use of the application.

7. Browser Compatibility:
   The application is assumed to be compatible with modern web browsers, without specific requirements for older browser versions.

8. User Roles:
   The current implementation assumes a single user role with full access to all features. Future improvements may include different user roles and permissions.

9. Concurrent Users:
   The current implementation assumes a moderate number of concurrent users, without specific optimizations for high concurrency scenarios.

10. Data Validation:
    It's assumed that the provided data validation rules are sufficient for the current use case, with the understanding that they may need to be expanded in the future.
